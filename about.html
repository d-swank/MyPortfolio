                    <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
                    <p>In my years of being in the Navy, I have gained many invaluable skills that helped me become 
                        the person I am today. During my time onboard the USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70), I grew into an 
                        outstanding leader and rigging supervisor while serving as one of the most trusted individuals 
                        in the most dangerous and complex evolutions and missions. As a Rig Captain, I successfully completed 
                        23 Underway Replenishment evolutions in the delivery of 1,356 pallets of Cargo and 25 million gallons 
                        of fuel with zero safety mishaps. I successfully conducted a critical task of driving a 1,100-foot 
                        aircraft carrier through 16 special evolutions traveling over 12,000 miles and 4 successful Pacific 
                        deployments. My talents and credentials far exceed those of my peers with a proven track record of 
                        leading other coworkers to success in every task assigned to me. Now I am currently pursuing a 
                        bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and am on track to get my degree at the end of May 2023. 
                        I am confident that with the skills and experience that I have gained from my past in the Navy, 
                        I will make an excellent addition to any organization seeking a Software Engineer and contribute 
                        immensely to the company’s success.
